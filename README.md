# Using LaTeX for thesis writing at the University of Washington

This is a template for the University of Washington Masters and Doctoral thesis in LaTeX maintained by [Jim Fox](http://staff.washington.edu/fox/tex/uwthesis.shtml).

I am reposting it to GitHub for the convinence/discoverability of others, but cannot guarantee the files are up to date. You should always consult with the [UW Grad School Guidelines](http://www.grad.washington.edu/students/etd/req-sections.shtml) to ensure your thesis is properly formatted.
